You want to build an AI-powered Smart Examination App with React Native and Expo 54. This is a complex project, but here's a plan to get started.\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Core Functionality:** Focus on the core exam generation and evaluation features.\n    *   Allow users to upload course materials (PDFs, Word docs, images, or text notes) or provide course outlines and titles.\n    *   Extract key topics and concepts from the uploaded materials using NLP and OCR (this part will require external APIs and services).\n    *   Automatically generate quizzes (initially focus on objective type) based on the extracted knowledge.\n    *   Allow users to select difficulty level.\n*   **Basic Exam Taking Experience:**\n    *   Provide an interactive timer and progress tracker during the test.\n    *   Automatically evaluate answers for objective type questions.\n    *   Display accuracy rate.\n*   **User Interface:**\n    *   Implement user authentication (consider Supabase for this).\n    *   Implement dark/light mode.\n    *   Create a responsive dashboard design.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light Gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#3f51b5` (Indigo)\n    *   Secondary: `#f44336` (Red)\n    *   Accent: `#ff4081` (Pink)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#bbdefb` (Light Blue)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for a professional look.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Enable Supabase:** Since you need user authentication, enable Supabase by pressing the Supabase button and connecting to a project.\n2.  **Implement the Plan:** I will create a plan for the coding agent to implement the features and design elements described above.\n3.  **Iterate and Refine:** After the initial implementation, you can iterate and refine the app based on user feedback and testing.\n\nHere's the plan for the coding agent:\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Ensure the project is set up with React Native, Expo 54, and the necessary dependencies (e.g., `@react-navigation/native`, `expo-router`, etc.).\n2.  **UI Components:** Create basic UI components for buttons, text inputs, progress trackers, and the dashboard layout.\n3.  **Authentication:** Implement user authentication using Supabase.\n4.  **File Upload:** Implement the file upload functionality.\n5.  **Exam Generation:** Implement the exam generation logic for objective type questions. This will likely involve creating a data structure to represent questions and answers.\n6.  **Exam Taking Experience:** Implement the interactive timer and progress tracker.\n7.  **Evaluation:** Implement the automatic evaluation of answers for objective type questions.\n8.  **Theming:** Implement dark/light mode.\n9.  **Dashboard:** Create a basic dashboard to display the accuracy rate and other relevant information.\n10. **Navigation:** Ensure seamless navigation between screens.\n11. **Remove modalDemos:** Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n12. **Modify app/(tabs) folder:** Modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-24T15:52:44.809280"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build this AI-powered Smart Examination App!
